# Allegory of the Cave

![](https://github.com/ozanbayiz/Allegory-of-the-Cave/blob/master/AotCGamePlayScreenshot.png)

A 2D Roguelike where you play as Plato in a cave.

This project is an extension of the Unity2D Roguelike. All assets present in this but not the original tutorial are my own creation.

Play the game [here](https://ozanbayiz.github.io/Allegory-of-the-Cave/). The formatting of the text is slightly off but should be fixed in fullscreen.
