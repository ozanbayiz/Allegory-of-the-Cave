# Allegory of the Cave
A 2D Roguelike where you play as Plato in a cave.

This project is an extension of the Unity2D Roguelike tutorial. All assets present in this but not the original tutorial are my own creation.

Play the game [here](https://ozanbayiz.github.io/Allegory-of-the-Cave/). The formatting of the text is odd by default but is fixed in fullscreen. (DISCLAIMER) This project is still a work in progress and there are some bugs I am working to fix. The build is susceptible to crashes so play the game at your own discretion.

Thanks for checking out my repo!
